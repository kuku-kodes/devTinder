# Both package.json and package-lock.json are important in a Node.js project, and here's why you should push both to Git:

- 📦 package.json
This file:

Lists all your project dependencies (e.g., React, Express)

Contains project metadata (name, version, scripts, etc.)

Allows others (or you) to install dependencies using: npm install

- 🟢 Think of it as a shopping list of what packages your project needs.

- 🔒 package-lock.json
This file:

Locks the exact version of each package and all nested dependencies

Ensures consistent installs across all environments (your machine, your teammate’s, production)

Helps avoid “works on my machine” bugs

🛠️ Think of it as the actual receipt showing exactly what was bought, including all sub-dependencies.
